  						It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
  						essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
  						Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
